description: |-
  The chemical formula for a structure as a string in a form chosen by the API implementation.

  **Requirements/Conventions**:

  - The chemical formula is given as a string consisting of properly capitalized element symbols followed by integers or decimal numbers, balanced parentheses, square, and curly brackets `(`,\ `)`, `[`,\ `]`, `{`, `}`, commas, the `+`, `-`, `:` and `=` symbols.
    The parentheses are allowed to be followed by a number.
    Spaces are allowed anywhere except within chemical symbols.
    The order of elements and any groupings indicated by parentheses or brackets are chosen freely by the API implementation.
  - The string SHOULD be arithmetically consistent with the element ratios in the `chemical_formula_reduced` property.
  - It is RECOMMENDED, but not mandatory, that symbols, parentheses and brackets, if used, are used with the meanings prescribed by [IUPAC's Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/sbcs/iupac/bibliog/blue.html).

  **Query examples**:

  - Note: the free-form nature of this property is likely to make queries on it across different databases inconsistent.
  - A filter that matches an exactly given formula: :filter:`chemical_formula_descriptive="(H2O)2 Na"`.
  - A filter that does a partial match: :filter:`chemical_formula_descriptive CONTAINS "H2O"`.
examples:
  - "(H2O)2 Na"
  - "NaCl"
  - "CaCO3"
  - "CCaO3"
  - "(CH3)3N+ - [CH2]2-OH = Me3N+ - CH2 - CH2OH"
