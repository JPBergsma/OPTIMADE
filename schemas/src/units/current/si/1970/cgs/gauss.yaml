description: |-
  A unit of magnetic flux density that correspond to 10⁻⁴ T defined using the 1976 SI base units.

  The International System of Units (SI), 1st ed. (1970) defines the gauss as "1 Gs corresponds to 10⁻⁴ T" with the footnote "This unit is part of the so-called «electromagnetic» 3-dimensional CGS system and cannot strictly speaking be compared to the corresponding unit of the International System, which has four dimensions when only mechanical and electric quantities are considered."

  The International System of Units (SI), 1th ed. (1970) categorizes the unit as "CGS units with special names."
  The International System of Units (SI), 9th ed. (2019) omits the CGS units.
