  A unit of kinematic viscosity equal to 0.0001 m²·s⁻¹ defined using the 1976 SI base units.

  The International System of Units (SI), 1st ed. (1970) defines the stokes as "1 St = 1 cm²/s = 10⁻⁴ m²/s".

  The International System of Units (SI), 1th ed. (1970) categorizes the unit as "CGS units with special names."
  The International System of Units (SI), 9th ed. (2019) omits the CGS units.
