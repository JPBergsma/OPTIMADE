description: |-
  A unit of dynamic viscosity equal to 0.1 N·s/m² defined using the 1976 SI base units.

  The International System of Units (SI), 1st ed. (1970) defines the poise as "1 P = 1 dyn·s/cm² = 0.1 Pa·s" with the footnote "This unit and its symbol were included in Resolution 7 of the 9th C.G.P.M. (1948)."
  (While the pascal appear in the 1st ed. as a symbol for N·s/m², it was adopted into SI at the 14th CGPM meeting in 1971.)

  The International System of Units (SI), 1th ed. (1970) categorizes the unit as "CGS units with special names."
  The International System of Units (SI), 9th ed. (2019) omits the CGS units.
