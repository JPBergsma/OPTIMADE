description: |-
  A unit of length primarily used in navigation defined as 1852 m using the 1960 SI meter.

  The nautical mile appear in the International System of Units (SI), 1th ed. (1970) defined as "1 nautical mile = 1852 m" with the footnote "The nautical mile is a special unit employed for marine and aerial navigation to express distance. The conventional value given above was adopted by the First International Extraordinary Hydrographic Conference, Monaco, 1929, under the name 'International nautical mile'."
  Historically, the nautical mile was defined as the meridian arc length corresponding to one arcminute of latitude.

  The International System of Units (SI), 9th ed. (2019) categorizes the unit as "Units in use temporarily with the International Sytem."
  The International System of Units (SI), 7th ed. (1998) changes the categorization to "Other non-SI units currently accepted for use with the International System" and adds to the footnote that: "As yet there is no internationally agreed symbol. This unit was originally chosen because one nautical mile on the surface of the Earth subtends approximately one minute of angle at the centre."

  This definition is referenced in a footnote as: "As decided at the XXVIII General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union (Resolution B2, 2012)."
