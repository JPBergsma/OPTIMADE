description: |-
  The kelvin is the SI base unit of thermodynamic temperature as defined at the 13th CGPM Meeting in 1967, resolution 3 and 4, and clarified at the 23rd CGPM Meeting in 2007, resolution 10.
  The kelvin, unit of thermodynamic temperature, is the fraction 1/273.16 of the thermodynamic temperature of the triple point of water.
  This definition refers to water having the isotopic composition defined by the following amount-of-substance ratios: 0.000 155 76 mole of ²H per mole of ¹H, 0.000 379 9 mole of ¹⁷O per mole of ¹⁶O and 0.002 005 2 mole of ¹⁸O per mole of ¹⁶O.
