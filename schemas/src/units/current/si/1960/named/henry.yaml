  A derived SI unit for inductance equal to kg·m²·s⁻²·A⁻² in the 1960 SI base units.

  "The henry is the inductance of a closed circuit in which an electromotive force of one volt is produced when the electric current passing through the circuit varies uniformly at a rate of one ampere per second." [9th CGPM meeting in 1946]
