  A supplementary SI unit of plane angle defined from the relation of the arc length on a circle intercepted at a given radius so that the full circule has an angle of 4Ï€ radians. It was defined at the 9th CGPM Meeting in 1948, resolution 6 and included into SI at the 11th CGPM Meeting in 1960, resolution 12.

  "The radian is the angle with its vertex at the center of a circle that intercepts an arc of length equal to the radius on the circumference of that circle." [9th CGPM Meeting in 1948, resolution 6].
