description: |-
  A derived SI unit of temperature, defined as degree kelvin offset with +273.15 in SI base units implicitly redefined with the redefinition in 1967 of kelvin.

  "If we add to the practical international Celsius temperatures defined above T₀ = 273.15 degrees, we obtain the practical international Kelvin temperatures. By subtracting T₀ from the thermodynamic temperatures, we obtain the thermodynamic Celsius temperatures." [13th CGPM meeting (1967)]
