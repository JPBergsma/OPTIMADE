  The kilogram is the SI base unit of mass defined according to the 2019 redefinition of the SI base units via the value of the Planck constant.

  "The kilogram, symbol kg, is the SI unit of mass. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the Planck constant \(h\) to be 6.62607015×10⁻³⁴ when expressed in the unit J⋅s, which is equal to kg⋅m²⋅s⁻¹, where the metre and the second are defined in terms of \(c\) and \(\Delta \nu_\textrm{Cs}\)."
