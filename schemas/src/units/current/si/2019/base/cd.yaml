description: |-
  The candela is the SI base unit of luminous intensity in a given direction defined according to the 2019 redefinition of the SI base units via the luminous efficacy of monochromatic radiation of frequency 540×10¹² Hz.

  "The candela, symbol cd, is the SI unit of luminous intensity in a given direction. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the luminous efficacy of monochromatic radiation of frequency 540×10¹² Hz, \(K_\mathrm{cd}\), to be 683 when expressed in the unit lm⋅W⁻¹, which is equal to cd⋅sr⋅W⁻¹, or cd⋅sr⋅kg⁻¹⋅m⁻²⋅s³, where the kilogram, metre and second are defined in terms of \(h\), \(c\) and \(\Delta \nu_\textrm{Cs}\)."
