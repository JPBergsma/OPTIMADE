description: |-
  The candela is the SI base unit of luminous intensity in a given direction defined according to the 2019 redefinition of the SI base units.
  It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the luminous efficacy of monochromatic radiation of frequency 540×10¹² Hz, \(K_\mathrm{cd}\), to be 683 when expressed in the unit lm⋅W⁻¹, which is equal to cd⋅sr⋅W⁻¹, or cd⋅sr⋅kg⁻¹⋅m⁻²⋅s³, where the kilogram, metre and second are defined in terms of \(h\), \(c\) and \(\Delta \nu_\textrm{Cs}\) [The International System of Units (SI), 9th Edition].
