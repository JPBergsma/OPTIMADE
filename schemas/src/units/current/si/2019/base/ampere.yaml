  The ampere is the SI base unit of electric current defined according to the 2019 redefinition of the SI base units.
  It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the elementary charge \(e\) to be 1.602176634×10⁻¹⁹ when expressed in the unit C, which is equal to A⋅s, where the second is defined in terms of \(\Delta \nu_\textrm{Cs}\) [The International System of Units (SI), 9th Edition].
