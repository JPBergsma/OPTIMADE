  The ampere is the SI base unit of electric current defined according to the 2019 redefinition of the SI base units via the elementary charge.

  "The ampere, symbol A, is the SI unit of electric current. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the elementary charge \(e\) to be 1.602176634×10⁻¹⁹ when expressed in the unit C, which is equal to A⋅s, where the second is defined in terms of \(\Delta \nu_\textrm{Cs}\)."
