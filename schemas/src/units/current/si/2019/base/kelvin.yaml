description: |-
  The kelvin is the SI base unit of thermodynamic temperature defined according to the 2019 redefinition of the SI base units.
  It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the Boltzmann constant k to be 1.380649×10⁻²³ when expressed in the unit J⋅K⁻¹, which is equal to kg⋅m²⋅s⁻²⋅K⁻¹, where the kilogram, metre and second are defined in terms of $h$, $c$ and $\Delta \nu_\textrm{Cs}$ [The International System of Units (SI), 9th Edition].
