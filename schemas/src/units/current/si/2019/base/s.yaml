  The SI base unit of time as defined in the 2019 redefinition of the SI units from the unperturbed ground-state hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium 133 atom.

  "The second, symbol s, is the SI unit of time. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the caesium frequency, \(\Delta \nu_\textrm{Cs}\), the unperturbed ground-state hyperfine transition frequency of the caesium 133 atom, to be 9192631770 when expressed in the unit Hz, which is equal to s⁻¹."
