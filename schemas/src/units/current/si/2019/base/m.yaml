  The metre (or meter) is the SI base unit of length as defined in the 2019 redefinition from the speed of light in vacuum.

  "The metre, symbol m, is the SI unit of length. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the speed of light in vacuum \(c\) to be 299792458 when expressed in the unit m⋅s⁻¹, where the second is defined in terms of the caesium frequency \(\Delta \nu_\textrm{Cs}\)."
