  The metre (or meter) is the SI base unit of length defined according to the 2019 redefinition of the SI base units.
  It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the speed of light in vacuum $c$ to be 299792458 when expressed in the unit m⋅s⁻¹, where the second is defined in terms of the caesium frequency $\Delta \nu_\textrm{Cs}$ [The International System of Units (SI), 9th Edition].
