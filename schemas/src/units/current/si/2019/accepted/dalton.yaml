description: |-
  A unit of mass defined as 1/12 of the mass of a free carbon 12 atom, at rest and in its ground state.

  The International System of Units (SI), 9th ed. (2019) categorizes the dalton as a "non-SI unit accepted for use with the SI units" and notes the (not exact) relationship "1 Da = 1.660 539 066 60(50)×10⁻²⁷ kg".
  It then defines the unit in a footnote: "The dalton (Da) and the unified atomic mass unit (u) are alternative names (and symbols) for the same unit, equal to 1/12 of the mass of a free carbon 12 atom, at rest and in its ground state. This value of the dalton is the value recommended in the CODATA 2018 adjustment."
  Note: in the 2019 redefinition of the SI units, the dalton is the only unit listed as accepted for use with SI that does not have an exact relation to the base SI units.
