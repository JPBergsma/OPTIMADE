description: |-
  A unit of mass defined as exactly 1000 kg, with kg defined according to the 2019 redefinition of SI units.

  The International System of Units (SI), 9th ed. (2019) categorizes the tonne as a "non-SI unit accepted for use with the SI units" and defines it as "1 t = 10Â³ kg".
  It is noted in a footnote that: "The tonne and its symbol, t, were adopted by the CIPM in 1879 (PV, 1879, 41). This unit is sometimes referred to as 'metric ton' in some English-speaking countries."
