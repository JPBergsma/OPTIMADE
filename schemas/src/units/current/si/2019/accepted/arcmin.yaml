description: |-
  A unit of plane and phase angle equal to 1/60 of a degree which is 1/21600 of a circle and equivalent to pi/10800 rad, with rad defined according to the 2019 redefinition of SI units.

  The International System of Units (SI), 9th ed. (2019) categorizes the "minute" of phase and plane angle as a "non-SI unit accepted for use with the SI units" and defines it as "1′ = (1/60)° = (π/10 800) rad".
  It is noted in a footnote that "arcsecond is an alternative name for second of plane angle" but "arcminute" and "arcmin" are not mentioned.
  The names "arcmin" and "arcminute" are defined in the GNU Units 3.15 unit database, defined as 1/60 degree.
