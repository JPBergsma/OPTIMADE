title: "electron volt"
symbol: "electronvolt"
display-symbol: "eV"
description: |-
  A unit of energy equal to the amount of kinetic energy acquired by an electron as it accelerates through a 1 volt potential difference in a vacuum, with volt defined according to the 2019 redefinition of the SI base units.

  The International System of Units (SI), 9th ed. (2019) categorizes the "electronvolt" as a "non-SI unit accepted for use with the SI units" and notes the exact relationship "1 eV = 1.602176634·10⁻¹⁹ J".
  It then defines the unit in a footnote: "The electron volt is the kinetic energy acquired by an electron after traversing a potential difference of 1 V in a vacuum."
  This definition makes the unit equal to 1 volt times the elementary charge which, using the 2019 redefinition of the SI base units, is exactly 1.602176634·10⁻¹⁹ C, making the electron volt exactly equal to 1.602176634·10⁻¹⁹ J.
