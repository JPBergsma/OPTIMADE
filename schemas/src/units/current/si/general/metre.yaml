  The metre, or meter, is the SI base unit of length, using the current or one of the historical SI definitions of the metre.

  This generalized definition of the metre is meant to be used when it is not possible to be more precise, e.g., when defining the unit of a property for which data is available across multiple historical definitions.

  In the 2019 redefinition of the SI base units the metre is defined via the speed of light in vacuum.

  "The metre, symbol m, is the SI unit of length. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the speed of light in vacuum \(c\) to be 299792458 when expressed in the unit m⋅s⁻¹, where the second is defined in terms of the caesium frequency \(\Delta \nu_\textrm{Cs}\)."
