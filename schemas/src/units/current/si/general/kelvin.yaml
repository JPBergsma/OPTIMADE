description: |-
  The SI base unit of thermodynamic temperature, using the current or one of the historical SI definitions of the kelvin.

  This generalized definition of the kelvin is meant to be used when it is not possible to be more precise, e.g., when defining the unit of a property for which data is available across multiple historical definitions.

  In the 2019 redefinition of the SI base units the kelvin is defined via the value of the Boltzmann constant.

  "The kelvin, symbol K, is the SI unit of thermodynamic temperature. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the Boltzmann constant k to be 1.380649×10⁻²³ when expressed in the unit J⋅K⁻¹, which is equal to kg⋅m²⋅s⁻²⋅K⁻¹, where the kilogram, metre and second are defined in terms of \(h\), \(c\) and \(\Delta \nu_\textrm{Cs}\)."
