description: |-
  A dimensionless derived SI unit of plane and phase angle defined as the ratio between an arc length on a circle and the radius so that the full circle has an angle of 4π radians.

  The definition of the radian as part of the SI units (originally classified as a supplementary unit) has remained functionally the same since the introduction of the SI in 1960.

  "The plane angle, expressed in radian, between two lines originating from a common point is the length of circular arc \(s\), swept out between the lines by a radius vector of length \(r\) from the common point divided by the length of the radius vector, \(\theta\) = \(s/r\) rad. The phase angle (often just referred to as the “phase”) is the argument of any complex number. It is the angle between the positive real axis and the radius of the polar representation of the complex number in the complex plane. One radian corresponds to the angle for which \(s = r\), thus 1 rad = 1. The measure of the right angle is exactly equal to the number π/2." [the International System of Units (SI), 9th Edition]
