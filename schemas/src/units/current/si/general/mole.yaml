  The SI base unit of of amount of substance, using the current or one of the historical SI definitions of the mole.

  This generalized definition of the mole is meant to be used when it is not possible to be more precise, e.g., when defining the unit of a property for which data is available across multiple historical definitions.

  In the 2019 redefinition of the SI base units the mole is defined via the value of Avogadro constant.

  "The mole, symbol mol, is the SI unit of amount of substance. One mole contains exactly 6.02214076×10²³ elementary entities. This number is the fixed numerical value of the Avogadro constant, \(N_A\), when expressed in the unit mol⁻¹ and is called the Avogadro number. The amount of substance, symbol \(n\), of a system is a measure of the number of specified elementary entities. An elementary entity may be an atom, a molecule, an ion, an electron, any other particle or specified group of particles." [26th CGPM Meeting (2018), resolution 1].
