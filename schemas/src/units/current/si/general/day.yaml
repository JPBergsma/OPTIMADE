description: |-
  A unit of time equal to 86 400 s, with s defined according to the current or one of the historical SI definitions of the second.

  This definition in general SI base units is meant to be used when it is not possible to be more precise, e.g., when defining the unit of a property for which data may use different historical definitions.

  The International System of Units (SI), 9th ed. (2019) categorizes the day as a "non-SI unit accepted for use with the SI units" and defines it as "1 d = 24 h = 86 400 s".
