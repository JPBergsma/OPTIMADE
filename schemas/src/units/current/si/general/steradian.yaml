description: |-
  A dimensionless derived SI unit of solid angle defined as the ratio between an area of the surface of a sphere and the square radius so that the entire sphere has a solid angle of 4Ï€ steradians.

  The definition of the steradian as part of the SI units (originally classified as a supplementary unit) has remained functionally the same since the introduction of the SI in 1960.

  "The solid angle, expressed in steradian, corresponds to the ratio between an area \(A\) of the surface of a sphere of radius \(r\) and the squared radius, \(\Omega = A/r^2\) sr. One steradian corresponds to the solid angle for which \(A = r^2\), thus 1 sr = 1." [the International System of Units (SI), 9th Edition]
