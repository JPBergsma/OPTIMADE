description: |-
  The SI base unit of electric current, using the current or one of the historical SI definitions of the ampere.

  This generalized definition of the ampere is meant to be used when it is not possible to be more precise, e.g., when defining the unit of a property for which data is available across multiple historical definitions.

  In the 2019 redefinition of the SI base units the ampere is defined via the elementary charge.

  "The ampere, symbol A, is the SI unit of electric current. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the elementary charge \(e\) to be 1.602176634×10⁻¹⁹ when expressed in the unit C, which is equal to A⋅s, where the second is defined in terms of \(\Delta \nu_\textrm{Cs}\)."
