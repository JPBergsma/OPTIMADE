title: "electron volt"
symbol: "eV"
display-symbol: "eV"
description: |-
  A unit of energy equal to the amount of kinetic energy acquired by an electron as it accelerates through a 1 volt potential difference in a vacuum, with volt defined according to the current or one of the historical SI definitions of the volt.

  This definition in general SI base units is meant to be used when it is not possible to be more precise, e.g., when defining the unit of a property for which data may use different historical definitions.

  The International System of Units (SI), 9th ed. (2019) categorizes the "electronvolt" as a "non-SI unit accepted for use with the SI units" and notes the exact relationship with the SI 2019 joule as "1 eV = 1.602176634·10⁻¹⁹ J".
  It then defines the unit in a footnote: "The electron volt is the kinetic energy acquired by an electron after traversing a potential difference of 1 V in a vacuum."
  This definition makes the unit equal to 1 volt times the elementary charge which, using the 2019 redefinition of the SI base units, is exactly 1.602176634·10⁻¹⁹ C, making the electron volt exactly equal to 1.602176634·10⁻¹⁹ J.
