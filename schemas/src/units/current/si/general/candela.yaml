  The SI unit of luminous intensity in the current or one of the historical SI definitions of the candela.

  Redefinitions of units in the SI system have strived to stay compatible with prior definitions.
  This general reference to the candela is meant to be used when it is not possible to be more precise, e.g., when defining the unit of a property for which data is available across multiple historical definitions (and perhaps it is not even known which version was used).

  In the 2019 redefinition of the SI base units the candela is defined via the luminous efficacy of monochromatic radiation of frequency 540×10¹² Hz.

  "The candela, symbol cd, is the SI unit of luminous intensity in a given direction. It is defined by taking the fixed numerical value of the luminous efficacy of monochromatic radiation of frequency 540×10¹² Hz, \(K_\mathrm{cd}\), to be 683 when expressed in the unit lm⋅W⁻¹, which is equal to cd⋅sr⋅W⁻¹, or cd⋅sr⋅kg⁻¹⋅m⁻²⋅s³, where the kilogram, metre and second are defined in terms of \(h\), \(c\) and \(\Delta \nu_\textrm{Cs}\)."
