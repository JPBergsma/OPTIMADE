      A static IRI identifier that is a URN or URL representing the specific version of the definition.

      (If it is a URL, clients SHOULD NOT assign any interpretation to the response when resolving that URL.)
      It SHOULD NOT be changed as long as the definition functionally remains identical, and SHOULD be changed when the definition changes.
      For example, definitions SHOULD be regarded as the same if they only differ by, e.g.:

      - Additions or corrections of clarifying or historical notes to the `description` field.
      - Changes to the fields `deprecated` and `$comment` on any level.

      Note that this means that the version number part of the URL is *retained* even in newer releases of the OPTIMADE standard as long as the definition remains functionally identical.

  defining-relation:
    description: |-
       A dictionary that encodes a defining relation to a unit or set of units, with the primary intended use of reproduce the definition of the entity in SI units, if such a relationship exists.
       Some units, e.g., the atomic mass unit (also known as dalton, commonly denoted `u`), only has an approximate relationship to SI units, in which case the `defining-relation` MUST be omitted or `null`.

       If the fields in `scale` are designated as `sn`, `sd`, and `se`; and the fields in `offset` are designated as `on`, `od`, and `oe`; and `base-units-expression` is designated as `b`, these fields state the following defining relation: a value `v` multiplied by the unit being defined is equal to the following expression `(v * (sn/sd) * 10**se + (on/od) * 10**oe)*b`, where `*` designates multiplication and `**` designates exponentiation.

      base-units-expression:
        description: |-
          A string expressing the base units part of the defining relation for the unit being defined.

          A compound unit expression is created by a sequence of constants, prefixes, and unit symbols separated by a single multiplication `*` symbol.
          Each unit symbol can also be suffixed by a single `^` symbol followed by a positive or negative integer to indicate the power of the preceding unit, e.g., `m^3` for cubic meter, `m^-3` for inverse cubic meter.
          (Positive integers MUST NOT be preceded by a plus sign.)
          Furthermore:

          - No whitespace, parenthesis, or other symbols than specified above are permitted.
          - The unit symbols MUST appear in alphabetical order.

          The four fields `numerator`, `denominator`, `base`, and `exponent` specify the value as the rational number `numerator` / `denominator`, multiplied by `base` to the power of `exponent`.
          If omitted or `null`, the defaults for the `numerator`, `denominator`, `base` and `exponent` are respectively 1, 1, 10, and 0.
